# ESP-to-ESP
Here we are using two ESP-01 to communicate between input and output systems connected to an arduino uno at each end. The example taken here is to control the LEDs connected to the output arduino using switches at the input end. 
We can control the LEDs using switches connected to the GPIO pins of ESP-01, as well as switches connected to arduino at input side.
At both ends, we have an ESP-01 - Arduino uno serial connection.
